# Rust Investment Tracker

### Backstory
I used to play a videogame called Rust, which was a paid standalone game. It was hosted on the platform Steam, which also has a marketplace component.
The marketplace works exaclty as a stock market might. Items are gained through loot boxes and gameplay, then can be sold on the marketplace for real money. Things like rarity and difficulty play into the prices of these items, but for the game rust it was a little different. New items would only be sold directly through the company for a week, then they would never be rerealeased, creating a ton of scarcity.

Me and my friends use to invest in these items, so I made an investment tracker to track total profit, and organize all my held and sold items into an organized interface. The way Steam did this was done very poorly so I chose to remake it.
